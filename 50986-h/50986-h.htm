<h2 id="c1">Glaciers of the Rockies and Selkirks</h2>
<p>The traveller going westwards from the prairie finds
the way blocked by a grim wall of cliffs rising 7,000
or 8,000 feet above the sea and justifying the name
of the &ldquo;Rockies&rdquo; given to our greatest chain of mountains.
Toward the end of the summer these desolate precipices are
snowless and except for a glimpse of white peaks through
some pass there is scarcely a suggestion of the glacier region
within. Then the train enters the &ldquo;Gap&rdquo; and before long the
summits around show fields or patches of midsummer snow;
and as one draws nearer to the heart of the Rockies there is
blue ice to be seen clinging to the cliffs or reaching as glaciers
down into the wooded valleys, and one is thrilled with the
wild charm of alpine scenery.</p>
<p>However, engineers are strict utilitarians and always choose
the lowest pass for a railway, so that the passenger in the
observation car catches only tantalizing glimpses of the wonders
and beauties of the ice world a few miles away and a few thousand
feet above the valley. One must stop at some place like
lake Louise in the southern Rockies or T&ecirc;te Jaune in the north
or Glacier in the Selkirks to come into real contact with snow
fields and glaciers. What a joy it is to get rid of the hot and
dusty everyday world of cities for a while and come close to
Nature in one of her wildest moods! It is not only the mountaineer
who feels the seduction of the cool, clean solitudes
where glaciers are born and do their wonderful work. Every
healthy manor woman must yield to the delight of living in
those inspiring surroundings.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to put on warm strong clothes and hob-nailed
shoes and fill your lungs with mountain air in a scramble
up to the snow fields to see how the glacial machinery works,
machinery which some thousands of years ago shaped almost
the whole surface of Canada, doing its work on the plains as
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
well as the mountains and leaving it the splendid land of lakes
and rivers and fertile prairies and rolling hills which it is to-day.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>Snowline.</i></h3>
<p>To reach the snows generally means some miles of walking
and climbing, often through forest covered slopes at first where
the outside world is lost. Then the trees begin to thin and grow
stunted, revealing between the trunks blue valleys with a lake
or two and far off cliffs and mountains. At last the trees cease
at 7,500 feet and you are at timberline. Here the three Rocky
mountain heathers spread soft thick carpets between stiff bushes
only a few feet high but with trunks a foot through, so buffeted
have they been by the storms of centuries. The rows of dwarfed
spruces leaning back against some rock ledge give fine shelter
for the mountain goats, wisps of whose white wool cling to the
stubborn branches.</p>
<p>Then come cliffs and rocky slopes and grassy or sedgy uplands
(the true alps as the word is used in Switzerland) where
mountain sheep or goats pasture and wild flowers grow by the
million, blue ones such as lupines, gentians, fox-gloves and
forget-me-nots; yellow ones such as adder-tongues, columbines
and a multitude of starry composite flowers; the red or orange
Indian paint brush; and white flowers innumerable. You
have reached the edge of the snow rapidly melting on a July
day under a sun that is hot even on high mountains. The
plants just freed from their winter covering are all bursting
into bloom together, bees are humming, butterflies lazily
flutter past and a humming bird poises over a blossom; for
it is spring at these altitudes and there is a whole season&rsquo;s work
to be done, seeds ripened and all, before autumn comes in
September with its snowstorms burying all under the white
silence of a nine-months winter again.</p>
<p>It is a thrilling experience to set foot at last on midsummer
snow sweeping upwards, gleaming toward the higher summits,
snow that never entirely melts and that is so dazzling in the
July sunlight that one needs dark or colored glasses to avoid
snow blindness if the tramp is to be a long one.</p>

</div>
<p>We have no special word in English for these perpetual
snow fields and so the French term <span class="small">N&Eacute;V&Eacute;</span> is commonly used.
Snowline is not nearly so definite as timberline and varies with
latitude, exposure and snowfall. In the eastern Rockies of
Alberta, where only a few feet fall in winter, the line is scarcely
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
below 9,000 feet; while in the western Selkirks, which catch
the full brunt of the Pacific winds laden with moisture and have
a snowfall of 40 or 50 feet in a year, snowline is depressed almost
to timberline, about 7,500 feet. This accounts for the bareness
of the eastern Rockies as compared with the splendid Alpine
features of the Selkirk range, which is the lower of the two.</p>
<p>While one gazes entranced at the array of lakes and valleys,
of snowfields and dark cliffs, the wind rises and mountains to
the west put on a cap of cloud. This grows and darkens and
presently a mantle of mist sweeps up with the wind, the sun
is dimmed and in a few minutes the wide world is shut out by
a blizzard. We must make our way down to lower levels where
sleet whitens the closing flowers, and then through a belt of
rain swept hillside into the valley where the sun may still be
shining hotly.</p>
<p>Since snow falls every month in the year on the n&eacute;v&eacute; fields
and never melts away one might expect the mountains, especially
the Selkirks, to grow as snowheaps into the sky; but of course
this does not take place. Under the increasing load of snow the
lower beds are compressed into ice; so that the n&eacute;v&eacute;, beginning
as loose or hard drifted snow above passes downwards into
ice banded with blue and white layers, the whole sometimes
hundreds of feet in thickness.</p>
<p>The snow accumulates only on the gentler slopes or in the
higher valleys. On cliffs it cannot lodge but piles upon the
n&eacute;v&eacute; beneath; and on steep slopes it may lie for a time but
now and then, especially toward spring, it breaks loose and
thunders down into the valley as an avalanche.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>The Motion of Glaciers.</i></h3>
<p>The final disposal of the snowfield, turned to ice in its lower
parts, comes by a slow creep downwards. That the n&eacute;v&eacute; is
actually in motion can be seen by following the slope of snow
to its upper edge against some mountain wall where a &ldquo;<span class="small">BERGSCHRUND</span>&rdquo;
generally yawns between the snowfield and the cliff.
This may be several feet wide, and may go down many feet to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
obscure depths. No amount of snow fall can fill the chasm
permanently, though it may be bridged with fresh snow for a
time, making a risky passage for the climber.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The n&eacute;v&eacute; is always pulling away from the rocks at its upper
border, and its general motion follows the direction of the lowest
depression beneath, finally extending below snowline as a
tongue of ice which reaches down into the valley until it is
melted by the increasing warmth of the lower levels. Thus
a glacier is born. Unless whitened by recent storms the glacier
is bare of snow in summer with a rough uneven surface of a
dirty blue green color, partly covered with rocky debris, and its
volume diminishes downward by thawing until at a definite
point the whole is melted and flows away as a river of water
instead of ice. The lower end is sometimes called the &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;
or &ldquo;snout&rdquo; or &ldquo;foot&rdquo; of the glacier&mdash;a bad case of mixed metaphors.</p>

<p class="caption">CREVASSE ON GREAT GLACIER</p>
</div>
<p>Remembering that ice is a hard and brittle solid, it comes
as a surprise to find that it can flow like a plastic body under
the pull of gravity; but this can be easily proved. A row of
stakes or of metal plates put across a glacier gradually gets out
of line, the middle parts moving fastest as in a river; but the
motion is very slow, even in the middle, seldom more than
a few inches a day in our mountain glaciers, though some of
the great Alaskan and Greenland glaciers are reported to move
several feet a day and in one or two cases as much as 60 or
70 feet.</p>

<p class="caption">MORAINE OF VICTORIA GLACIER</p>

<p>At a sudden descent, where a river would leap as a waterfall,
a glacier simply breaks across in what are called &ldquo;<span class="small">CREVASSES</span>,&rdquo;
fissures which may be several feet wide and hundreds
of feet long, going down to blue black depths appalling to the
inexperienced climber. As the glacier advances these crevasse
are bent out of shape and may be crossed by fresh crevasses,
splitting up the ice into wild lumps and pinnacles called &ldquo;<span class="small">SERACS</span>.&rdquo;
Seen from a distance across some valley such an ice fall looks
like a cascade or a violent rapid covered with breakers. Below
these steep descents the crevasses and seracs disappear by the
pressure of the moving ice and the glacier becomes a solid mass
again. Small glaciers hanging from cliffs may send down
avalanches of ice which combine to make a lower glacier, the
masses being welded together once more. It is evident that
one cause of glacier motion is the power which ice has to break
and then to freeze together again.</p>

<p class="caption">LAKE AGNES, A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CIRQUE LAKE</p>
</div>
<p>Since glaciers are often the easiest way up a mountain,
climbing parties make use of them, starting at dawn so as
to have a long day and following up the rough and rigid slope,
zigzagging round crevasses and avoiding regions of seracs.
Toward the upper end there may be fresh snow bridging the
crevasses and the party should be roped together and travel in
single file, the leading guide thrusting his ice axe into the snow
at every step to make sure of safe going. A fall into a crevasse
when unroped may be fatal. Seventeen years ago, while
climbing Mt. Gordon north of lake Louise, Mr. C. S. Thompson
slipped 60 feet into a crevasse where he was wedged in between
the narrowing walls. Dr. Collie was lowered to rescue him,
and he was finally pulled out by a glacier rope fastened round
his arms, but it was a narrow escape.</p>
<p>When the sun shines warmly on the glacier melting begins
and water trickles down the ice ridges, and towards afternoon
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
torrents of pale blue water are racing downwards in ice channels,
here and there plunging into a crevasse. This becomes hollowed
into a tube like the penstock of a water power and the
foamy torrent springing into the blue chasm is called a &ldquo;moulin,&rdquo;
or mill. In this way the waters thawed from the surface
reach the bottom and there roar along through an ice tunnel
to the end of the glacier, bursting into daylight as a full fledged
river.</p>
<p>Glacial streams are capricious. On a frosty morning scarcely
any water flows and one can go far into the ice cave, but in the
late afternoon there is a raging torrent loaded with mud and
stones spreading into half a dozen channels on the broad flood
ground. On a rainy or snowy day when the sun is hidden, the
glacial river almost goes out of business, but comes to life again
when the clouds vanish and the sun shines. At those heights
with a clear sky the heat of the sun may be intense though
it is freezing a few feet away where some rock casts a shadow.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>The Work of Glaciers.</i></h3>
<p>One of the most interesting points in a glacier is its carrying
power. Though it is in motion like a plastic substance it is
solid and strong enough to support any weight loaded upon it.
Debris quarried by frost from the mountain side buries its
edge so that often one may walk 50 yards out before the ice
can be seen. This fringe of broken rock carried on the edge
of the glacier is called a marginal moraine. When two glaciers
join, the marginal moraines between them unite to form a medial
moraine, and when several tributaries combine to make a large
glacier the dark lines of the medial moraines can be followed
by the eye for long distances upwards to rocky peaks rising
out of the n&eacute;v&eacute;, the source from which the train of rocks was
derived.</p>
<p>Blocks even as large as cottages now and then roll down
upon the ice and are transported without trouble. Medium
size blocks a few feet across called &ldquo;glacier tables&rdquo; are left
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
standing on pedestals of ice, as thawing goes on all round them,
since they protect the ice beneath from the sun.</p>
<p>The whole mass of stony material is carried steadily onwards
until the end is reached where melting is complete and no more
burdens can be borne. Then a terminal moraine is piled up,
a steep and rugged crescent of loose blocks by no means easy
to scramble over.</p>
<p>Work just as important is going on out of sight beneath the
glacier, where fragments of stone frozen into the bottom of
the ice form tools for gouging, carving and scouring the rocky
floor, both tools and rocks being ground up into the &ldquo;rock
flour&rdquo; that makes the glacier streams so milky and opaque.
The ground up material mixed with stones of all shapes and
sizes without any assortment is left behind when the glacier
thaws as &ldquo;boulder clay.&rdquo; A little search in this clay shows
stones with polished and striated surfaces, well worn tools,
often called &ldquo;soled boulders&rdquo; and the rock surface beneath
the boulder clay is seen to be rounded, smoothed and grooved
in a very striking way.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>The Retreat of Glaciers.</i></h3>
<p>Our glaciers, like those of other countries, are now almost
all in retreat, either because the climate is slowly growing
warmer so that thawing goes on faster or because the snowfall
is lessening so that the n&eacute;v&eacute; fields no longer feed the glaciers
as substantially as before. On this account one can often
see several terminal moraines down the valley below the one
now forming. The nearest to the present end of the ice is almost
bare, the next, a few hundred yards away, may have bushes
growing on it, and others a mile or two away may be covered
with ancient forest.</p>
<p>For some years past the Vaux family of Philadelphia, two
brothers and a sister, all admirable photographers, have fixed
the position of the end of all accessible glaciers by marking
points and directions on rocks near by and by photographing
the snout of the glacier. This work determines their rate of
advance or recession from year to year, and a record of the
results is published in the journal of the Alpine Club of Canada
and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="caption">LAKE LOUISE AND VICTORIA GLACIER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Glaciers once filled all the mountain valleys and even pushed
out through the passes into the prairies and through the fiords to
the sea, for everywhere one finds boulder clay and moraines
and valleys with U shaped cross sections that can only be
accounted for by glacial action on a large scale. This work
was done during the Ice Age, and one may truly say that the
higher mountains are still in the Glacial Period.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful results of former ice action is to
be found in the &ldquo;cirques,&rdquo; half Kettle or arm chair valleys, high
up among the mountains overhanging the main valleys and
enclosed by vertical cliffs on all sides except in front. These
are the deserted nests of cliff glaciers, hollowed out by the ice
itself and often deepened so that a turquoise blue lake lies within
rock rims. If not too high up these cirque lakes are surrounded
by evergreen forest, behind which rise the gray or purple walls
of rock with some snow in the ravines above, the whole mirrored
in the lake, until some catspaw of breeze shatters the reflection.
Lake Agnes in the mountains behind lake Louise is an easily
reached example of a cirque basin, and there are hundreds of
others scattered through the fastnesses of the mountains, all gems
in their way, many not yet seen by the eye of a white man.
The higher cirque lakes, above timberline, enclosed only by cliffs
and snow, have an austere beauty of their own, but lack the
graces and the wild flowers of their sisters below in the forest
zone.</p>
<p>Often the walls of such valleys are leaped by streams from
some melting snowfield falling hundreds of feet and reaching
the bottom as mere threads of spray.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>Glaciers Reached by the Canadian Pacific</i></h3>
<p>There are very few parts of the world where fine glacial
scenery can be found so close to a great railway as in our
mountain parks. If one stops at lake Louise, in Rocky
Mountains Park, the splendid Victoria glacier is in view doubled
by reflection in its waters, which get their exquisite color from
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the last remaining particles of mud brought down by the glacial
stream. Two miles walk or ride along a good trail brings one
into its presence, and often great masses of ice may be seen
avalanching down from cliff glaciers above to the surface of
the lower glacier. From lake Louise as a centre one can reach
the well named Paradise valley by ten miles ride or drive over
a good road and visit the fine Horseshoe glacier at its head.
The valley of the Ten Peaks farther to the southeast requires
a somewhat longer ride or drive, passing the splendid front of
Mt. Temple, the highest summit in sight from the railway (11,626
feet). Moraine lake, eleven miles from lake Louise lies near
the entrance of the valley but farther up can be seen the great
Wenkchemna glacier, and several small glaciers lying between
the Ten Peaks. Beyond the Ten Peaks to the south there is
a broad snowfield and glacier leading over to Prospector&rsquo;s
valley and Vermilion pass, but for an excursion of such length
and difficulty one should be equipped for serious climbing and
have a light camp outfit.</p>
<p>From any high point west of lake Louise one can catch glimpses
of a much larger snowfield towards the north near Mts. Daly
and Balfour, but the glaciers flowing from it are not so easily
reached as those to the south of the railway.</p>
<p>There are glaciers in sight during most of the descent by rail
from the summit of the pass through the wild Kickinghorse
valley to Field, in the Yoho Park, from which the Yoho valley
may be visited with Yoho glacier at its head. Descending
beyond this into the warm depths of the Columbia valley the
alpine type of scenery is lost for a time. As the railway climbs
laboriously westward out of the valley into the Selkirks,
Glacier Park is entered. Here the scenery grows more striking
until at Rogers pass one is once more surrounded by snow
peaks&mdash;hidden, alas! too often by the long snowshed.
The five mile tunnel now being pierced to avoid the heavy
grades of the pass will cut out many a ravishing view of snow
peak and ice tongue; but a stay at Glacier, just beyond the
pass, gives an unrivalled chance to study a fine glacier with the
least possible trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The Illecillewaet or Great glacier is only a mile and a half
from Glacier station and as its foot may be reached with very
little climbing, more travellers visit it than any other glacier
in Canada. A climb to Mt. Lookout just west of the glacier
gives a magnificent view over the Illecillewaet glacier and
n&eacute;v&eacute; and over the grand mountains surrounding it. This
region was the first part of our snowy mountains to be carefully
explored and mapped by a skilful climber. The Rev. W.
Spotswood Green made Glacier his headquarters for this work
in 1888 and published his interesting book &ldquo;Among the Selkirk
Glaciers&rdquo; in 1890.</p>

<p>There are still finer snowfields and glaciers in the little
explored region to the north around Mt. Sir Sandford, the highest
point in the range (11,634 feet), though these are out of reach
for the present; but any of the higher peaks near Glacier
give a marvellous view over a wilderness of snow and ice
broken by cliffs too steep for snow to lie.</p>

<p>Some of the lower points of the Selkirks, just west of the
Columbia valley, not more than 7,000 or 8,000 feet
in height, face the opposite Rocky mountains with 100 or
more glaciers in sight at once, the view beyond the wide and
deep valley sweeping 150 miles of the main chain on its snowy
western side. Unfortunately up to the present no path has
been made to such a lookout point, and the dense forest makes
the ascent difficult.</p>
<p>The greatest n&eacute;v&eacute; in Canada, so far as known, is the Columbia
snowfield covering 100 square miles and sending tongues of
ice down into a dozen valleys, but this is 80 miles northwest of
Lake Louise and can only be visited with a camp outfit and
packtrain. Its northern limit will be within new boundaries
of Jasper Park and some day a good road will lead through
the mountains past this splendid glacier region from the Grand
Trunk Pacific to the Canadian Pacific opening up to the public
the finest glacial playground in Canada.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>The Robson Region.</i></h3>
<p>The beauties of the Louise, Field and Glacier regions on
the Canadian Pacific are well known to the public and have been
seen by thousands but the exceedingly impressive glacial
surroundings of Mt. Robson near the Yellowhead Pass on the
Grand Trunk Pacific have so far been little visited. Mt.
Robson, rising 13,087 feet above the sea, the highest point in
the Canadian Rockies, is invisible from the pass itself, hidden
by the nearer Rainbow mountains but bursts upon the view
where Grand Forks river enters the Fraser. Only a few miles
away at the head of the low valley its tremendous cliffs, mostly
too steep for snow to lie, rise for 10,000 feet, crowned with a
snowy pyramid. A trail leads up the Grand Forks through
the valley of a Thousand Falls where the main river tumbles
1,500 feet in a wild canyon and reaches the rear side of Mount
Robson 5,700 feet above the sea. From some low mountains
to the northwest there is perhaps the most splendid view in
North America of mountains, glaciers and lakes. The blue
seracs of the Tumbling glacier seem to be rushing down thousands
of feet from the Helmet and the main peak of Robson to plunge
into Berg lake, which doubles them by reflection. To the
left the main glacier, starting in great icefalls on the northeast
of the peak, sweeps a curve of five or six miles round the dark
rocks of the Rearguard. Behind the main glacier toward the
south rises the unbroken snow slope of Mt. Resplendent ending
with a projecting cornice of snow at 11,000 feet.</p>

<p class="caption">CREVASSE, ROBSON GLACIER</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The water coming from the ice caves of the main glacier
flows chiefly into Berg lake and the Grand Forks, but a smaller
part reaches lake Adophus and Smoky river, a tributary of the
Mackenzie river, the same glacier sending tribute to the Arctic
and the Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>There are other striking mountains in the region, such as
Mt. Geikie to the south of the Yellowhead pass and the Whitehorn
to the north, though none rival Mt. Robson itself; but
much remains for exploration and it will be years before this
northern region of the Rockies, all the Alberta side of which
is in Jasper Park, is thoroughly known and mapped. Trails
are being rapidly built in the park, however, and with the
erection of hotels at Jasper and other points it will soon be
possible for the alpine climber and the tourist to find easy access
to this delightful region.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>Some Comparisons.</i></h3>
<p>Much of the exploration of the Canadian Rockies and Selkirks
has been done by Englishmen and eastern Americans who
received their training as mountaineers in the Alps, and one
naturally asks why they should travel thousands of miles to
our western mountains when the Alps are so much more accessible.
There is, of course, the charm of a virgin and unexplored
wilderness in our Rockies and Selkirks, so seductive to one who
loves adventure; but there are other attractions as well which
make our mountains fully the equal of the famous European
range. Every type of Alpine scenery is as well illustrated in
Canada as in Switzerland and the area of snow mountains in
Alberta and British Columbia is several times that of the Alps.
The whole length of the Alps is less than 400 miles and its breadth
from 50 to 80; as compared with a length of 1,200 miles and a
breadth of 140 miles for the Rockies and Selkirks, not to mention
the Gold ranges, the Coast range and the Vancouver Island
mountains, all of which have their snow fields and glaciers.
Stuttfield and Collie in their delightful book &ldquo;Climbs and
Explorations in the Canadian Rockies&rdquo; say of the Rockies that
&ldquo;they have a remarkable individuality and character in addition
to special beauties of their own which Switzerland cannot rival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though there are higher mountains in the Rockies of the
United States, they rise from a dry and lofty tableland and most
of them have little snow and no glaciers. But for the row of
extinct volcanoes beginning with Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier and
Mt. Shasta, the United States has very little truly alpine scenery
except where our Rocky mountain ranges extend for a degree
or two south of the boundary. A great many of the mountain
climbers of the eastern states come to Alberta or British
Columbia when they want to use an ice axe or a glacier rope and
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
most of their experienced climbers are members of the Alpine
Club of Canada.</p>
<p>Canadians themselves are often not aware of the splendid
scenery and the unsurpassed opportunities for climbing of all
grades of difficulty offered by their own mountains. There is
no more exhilarating sport than that of the mountaineer, and
there is no more interesting region for the geologist, the botanist
or the zoologist than the grand ranges of mountains that run
parallel to the Pacific in our western territory. While tourists
from all over the world are being attracted more and more
to our glorious alpine region it is especially important that our
own people should seek a delightful holiday and gain health
and vigor in our mountain parks. As good roads and trails and
cabins for shelter are extended to the wilder and more impressive
parts of the mountains it becomes easier for the ordinary visitor
to study the sublimities of valleys, glaciers and mountain
peaks once out of reach without an expensive camp equipment.</p>
<p>A few good Swiss guides are available at the more important
centres in the mountains and the inexperienced climber should
not undertake any difficult glacier work nor bad rock climbing
without the aid of a guide. There is of course a wide range of
less difficult walks and climbs that brings one without risk into
the heart of the mountains where one may study the ways by
which snowfields and glaciers and glacial rivers do their work
of shaping the mountains.</p>

<p>If one halts by chance anywhere on a mountain pass, all
sorts of thrilling things are going on around. Lovely flowers
are opening eagerly to the sun and wind of Spring&mdash;in mid
August, with September snows just at hand, a whole year&rsquo;s
work of blossom and seed to be accomplished before the ten
months&rsquo; winter Sleep begins. Bees are tumbling over them
intoxicated with honey and the joy of life while it is summer.
Even the humming-birds, with jewels on their breasts as if
straight from the tropics, are not afraid to skim up the mountain
sides, poise over a bunch of white heather, and pass with a
flash from flower to flower. The marmots with aldermanic
vests are whistling and &ldquo;making hay while the sun shines,&rdquo;
and one may see their bundles of choice herbs spread on a flat
stone to dry, while the little striped gophers are busy too. Time
enough to rest in the winter.</p>
<p>Everything full of bustle and haste and of joy, what could
be more inspiring than the flowery meadows above tree-line
when the warm sun shines in the six weeks of summer! The
full splendour and ecstacy of a whole year&rsquo;s life piled into six
weeks after the snow has thawed and before it falls again!</p>
<p>Higher up even the snow itself is alive with the red snow
plant and the black glacier flea, like the rest of the world making
the most of summer; and as you take your way across the
snow to the mountain top, what a wonderful world opens out!
How strangely the world has been built, bed after bed of limestone
or slate or quartzite, pale grey or pale green or dark red
or purple, built into cathedrals or castles, or crumpled like
colored cloths from the rag-bag, squeezed together into arches
and troughs, into V&rsquo;s and S&rsquo;s and M&rsquo;s ten miles long and two
miles high; or else sheets of rock twenty thousand feet thick
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
have been sliced into blocks and tilted up to play leap-frog
with one another.</p>
<p>And then the sculpturing that is going on! One is right in
the midst of the workshop bustle where mountains are being
carved into pinnacles, magnificent cathedral doors that never
open, towers that never had a keeper&mdash;all being shaped before
one&rsquo;s eyes out of the mighty beds and blocks of limestone and
quartzite that were once the sea bottom. You can watch the
tools at work, the chisel and gouge, the file and the sandpaper.
All the workmen are hard at it this spring morning in August;
the quarryman Frost has been busy over night, as you hear
from the thunder of big blocks quarried from the cliffs across
the valley; there is a dazzling gleam on the moist, polished
rock which craftsman Glacier has just handed over to the
daylight; and you can watch how recklessly the waterfall is
cutting its way down, slicing the great banks of rock with
canyons!</p>
<p>It is inspiring to visit the mountains any day in the year,
but especially so in the July and August springtime when a fresh
start is made, and plants, animals, patient glaciers, hustling
torrents, roaring rivers, shining lakes are all hard at work rough
hewing or putting finishing touches on an evernew world.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;From the physical geographer&rsquo;s point of view, every feature
of the Alps has its counterpart somewhere in the Rockies;
folds and faults and tilted strata are carved into an infinitude
of shapes, including risky peaks and aiguilles; snow and ice
are present in every form, smooth and easy or torn with blue
crevasses and splintered into daring seracs. There is every
variety of stream at work, clear or muddy, gentle or furious,
including much larger rivers in much longer valleys than any
in the Alps. Small lakes are far more numerous and beautiful.
Every element of interest and beauty on the physical side is as
well developed somewhere in the Rockies as it is in the Alps
but from my own observation I may suggest that often the
Alpine mountain group is better posed, the picture better
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
composed from the point of view of the beholder, than in the
Rockies. The reason for this is I believe, largely one of area.
The comparatively small mass of the Alps is more statuesque
and more easily seen from the proper point of view than any
part of the Cordilleran region, which sprawls over a hundred
thousand square miles. This seeming lack of focus and concentration
of dramatic points seems to me the greatest defect
of the Rockies as compared with the Alps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a cleanness and virginity, an
exquisite loneliness about many of the Rocky Mountain peaks
and valleys that has a peculiar charm. There is the feeling
of having made a new discovery, of having caught Nature
unawares at her work of creation, as one turns off from a scarcely-beaten
route into one never trodden at all by the feet of white
men; and this experience may be had in a thousand valleys
among the Rockies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c10">Five Great Glaciers in the Canadian National Parks</h2>
<p class="center">By A. O. Wheeler
<br />Director Alpine Club of Canada</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Yoho Glacier.</i></h3>
<p>The Yoho glacier is situated at the head of the Yoho valley
and is of very spectacular appearance. It presents a magnificent
cascade of broken ice falling into the valley a long way below
timber line and the forest is seen thickly clothing the heights
far above it.</p>
<p>The glacier is of the alpine type. It has its origin in the
Wapta icefield, a wide snow covered tract of ice with an area
of some twenty-five square miles, and affords one of the principal
overflows that maintain the yearly accumulation of snow on
this great basin at a constant level.</p>
<p>The glacier presents a splendid opportunity for study and
observation. It is readily accessible by the pony trails that
traverse the valley and can be reached in a day from either
Emerald lake chalet or the Takakkaw falls summer camp, to
both of which places good driving roads are open from the
village of Field on the C.P.R. railway.</p>
<p>From glaciers at the summit of Balfour pass, lying some two
and a half miles east of Yoho glacier, Waves creek flows westward
and is the main source of Yoho river. Until recently the bed
of Waves creek, a deep, narrow rock canyon, lay, at its terminal
point, beneath the icefall of the Yoho glacier and there joined
with the flow from it, reappearing at the nose of the glacier as
the Yoho river. As a result of this combination, during the
summer months, a very beautiful ice cave was formed at the nose
of the glacier, which was a source of much delight to visitors.
The ice, however, has been in retreat for many years and has
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
now gone back so far that the bed of Waves creek is quite clear
of it and the great ice arch formed yearly by its torrent is no
longer seen.</p>
<p>In 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada, through the writer,
began observations and measurements of the flow and advance
of retreat of the ice. Such observations were carried on steadily,
year by year, until 1919, when, owing to the ice tongue having
shrunken very greatly and having become much crevassed, they
were discontinued.</p>
<p>During the period of twelve years it has been found by measurements
from marked rocks that the ice has receded 396 feet;
also by means of metal plates placed on the surface of the forefoot
the movement of which was annually measured, it was
found that the mean average rate of surface flow of the ice has
been 3&middot;3 inches per day for the period mentioned.</p>
<p>The Yoho glacier is but one half a dozen that flow from the
Wapta icefield, and the icefield itself one of many such wide
snow-filled basins that lie among the crest of the Main Range
of the Rocky mountains and culminate in the great Columbia
icefield with an area of 110 square miles of ice and snow, reaching
out with numerous ramifications and many magnificent ice-falls.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><i>Victoria Glacier.</i></h3>
<p>The Victoria glacier is of the <i>alpine type</i>, that is, has its
origin in the snow that accumulates at the summit of the Abbot
pass, and is fed by snow and ice avalanching from the adjacent
slopes of Mts. Lefroy and Victoria.</p>
<p>It flows in a narrow channel between the precipitous sides
of the two mountains named, which is known as the death
Trap, owing to the number of avalanches that are precipitated
from side to side directly across its bed. It is wise to make the
traverse of this part of the glacier during the early morning
hours before avalanches begin to fall. The altitude of the pass
is 9,588 feet above sea level. The snow covered part of the
glacier, or n&eacute;v&eacute;, below the pass lies at an altitude of about
7,500 feet. The Lefroy glacier comes in as a tributary from the
southeast from below the cliffs of Mt. Lefroy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The length of the Victoria glacier is about 2&frac34; miles. The
Lefroy glacier is about 1 mile in length. The combined glaciers
flow down the valley. The forefoot or tongue of the glacier is
covered by a thick veneer of rock detritus carried down by the
flow of the ice and fallen from the cliffs of Popes peak on the west
side, and Mt. Aberdeen on the east. The ice terminates at
from 1&frac12; to 2 miles from the end of lake Louise. Owing to the
close proximity of the glacier to Lake Louise Ch&acirc;teau, the
C.P.R. tourist hotel, and its easy access therefrom it is of great
interest on account of the many spectacular features it present
and its unique setting of cliffs and snow clad mountains.
Particularly may be mentioned the number of avalanches that
thunder into Death Trap daily and the exhibit of semi-circular
markings, known as &ldquo;Forbes dirt bands&rdquo; seen on the body of
the ice opposite the junction with the Lefroy glacier.</p>
<p>The Victoria glacier has been steadily receding for many
years. Observations carried on by George and William S.
Vaux, and later by Miss Mary Vaux of Philadelphia (now
Mrs. Charles Walcott), show that between 1898 and 1903 the
glacier receded about 17 feet annually or about 85 feet for the
5 years. Subsequent measurements by Miss Vaux show that
for the year 1909 to 1912 the ice receded 43 feet. The amount
of recession is small compared with that of other glaciers, but
a reason is found in the fact that the whole ice forefoot is thickly
covered with a veneer of broken rock which protects it from
the sun&rsquo;s rays and reduces the melting process to a minimum.</p>
<p>Of late years no measurements have been made for advance
or retreat of the ice but, as all the most prominent glaciers of
the Canadian Rockies are known to be receding, it is assumed
that the same has been the case with the Victoria glacier.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><i>Wenkchemna Glacier.</i></h3>
<p>The Wenkchemna glacier lies at the northern base of the
Ten Peaks in the valley of Moraine lake. The name is of
Sioux Indian origin, Signifying ten, and was given to the glacier
by Mr. S. E. S. Allen, an early explorer, in relation to the Ten
Peaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>It is of the <i>piedmont type</i> of glacier, that is, has its source
from a number of commensal streams of ice, fed by snow falling
upon the eastern slopes of the Ten Peaks. These independent
streams descend to the valley of Moraine lake and are so close
to one another that when they reach the floor of the valley they
spread out laterally and join together, forming a single glacier
with a breadth of about three miles and a length of from one-half
to one mile. Its supply is maintained by the independent
ice streams referred to above. Glaciers so formed are known
as the &ldquo;piedmont type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wenkchemna glacier lies at an altitude between 6,400
feet and 7,500 feet and the easternmost nose is about 400 feet
higher than that of the Victoria glacier.</p>
<p>No systematic observations of the Wenkchemna glacier have
been made but it has been visited and photographed several
times by Messrs. William S. and George Vaux, and Miss Vaux
of Philadelphia. Their observations have shown that the glacier
has made an advance while all the other glaciers in the district
have been in retreat. In its advance, it has encroached on the
living forest and has crushed and thrown down the green timber.
Its advance is probably due to the fact that its surface is thickly
covered with broken rock, fallen from the precipitous sides of
the Ten Peaks, and the melting of the ice has been less than the
accession it receives from the ice streams that feed it.</p>
<p>In the absence of systematic observations and measurements
it is not known whether it is continuing to advance, is stationary
or is in retreat. Like the Victoria glacier it affords a feature
of very great interest for observation and scientific study,
owing to its easy access from Lake Louise Ch&acirc;teau and the
summer camp for visitors which is maintained at Moraine lake
close to the glacier.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><i>Illecillewaet Glacier.</i></h3>
<p>The Illecillewaet glacier is commonly referred to as the Great
glacier of the Selkirks, although it is by no means the largest
one. It is, however, one of the most spectacular, and is seen
from Glacier House, the C.P.R. Hotel near the railway summit of
the range, falling some five thousand feet from skyline of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
icefield in which it has its source. Seen from high up on the
opposite mountain side, it presents a bird&rsquo;s-eye view that is
unique and altogether entrancing.</p>
<p>The glacier is of the <i>alpine type</i> and is fed by the overflow
from the Illecillewaet icefield, which contains an area of some
ten square miles. The icefall is of special interest, owing to
the fact that it is situated about one and a half miles from the
hotel and is reached by a delightful pony trail through primeval
forest&mdash;forest presenting a most picturesque setting of giant
cedar, hemlock and spruce trees, and, at their base, an impenetrable
tangle of thick undergrowth, midst which the many-spined
devil&rsquo;s club repels the would-be explorer by its poisonous
punctures. This barrier is of semi-tropical luxuriance and is
justly famous in the valleys of the Selkirks. It is, however, not
without its attractions, for the wonderful collection of ferns, the
bright berries of the devil&rsquo;s club, the handsome white flowers
of the wild rhododendron and the luscious fruit of the huckleberry
are most alluring.</p>
<p>There are two other special features for which the Illecillewaet
glacier is famous. One is the low altitude at which the nose of
the ice-fall is found, 4,800 feet, while timber line lies at 7,300
feet; consequently the ice extends 2,500 feet down into the virgin
forest. The other is the immense terminal moraines, consisting
of great blocks of rock weighing hundreds of tons, which are
seen across the valley below the glacier. These moraines have
been deposited by the ice many hundred years ago and are now
grown with huge trees and other forest growth. Owing to their
appearance and the frequent cave-like openings between blocks,
they are referred to by Dr. Sherzer, in his treatise on the subject,
as &ldquo;Bear Den Moraines&rdquo;. The ice has now retreated a long
way from them.</p>
<p>Some years ago the Illecillewaet glacier presented a fine ice
cave at its snout which was much visited by tourists from
Glacier House, but owing to the continued retreat and shrinkage
to which the icefall has been subjected for many years, it is now
a feature of the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Observations and measurements of the ice-fall were carried on
during a series of years by Messrs. Vaux and Miss Vaux (Mrs.
Charles Walcott) of Philadelphia, the results of which may be
summarized as follows:</p>
<p>August 17th, 1898, the most advanced point of the ice forefoot
was 60 feet from a deeply imbedded marked boulder. On
July 24, 1906, it was 327 feet from the same boulder. On
the 19th July, 1912, the ice was found to have retreated 615
feet from the boulder. Since then the ice has receded very
considerably and the forefoot shrunken greatly in size and
spectacular appearances. Of late years the measurements do
not seem to have been continued and the distance from the
boulder is not known to the writer. The average maximum
surface flow of the ice forefoot during the periods 1898 to
1912 appears from the observations referred to above to
have been approximately five inches per day.</p>
<p>Directly above the icefall towers the Selkirk giant, Mt. Sir
Donald, 10,808 feet above sea level, which furnishes one of the
most attractive climbs of the region for mountaineers. From
its summit is seen a world of snowy peaks, widespread icefields,
tumbling glaciers and winding silver streams in the depths of
darkly forested valleys filled with violet haze.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><i>Asulkan Glacier.</i></h3>
<p>Tributary to the valley of the Illecillewaet glacier is the
Asulkan (Wild Goat) valley, which is, perhaps, the most beautiful
specimen of a mountain valley traversed by a rushing glacier
torrent, that can be found. On either hand are towering mountain
slopes and precipices, exalted rock ledges from which spectacular
waterfalls leap from great heights, overhanging snow
crests which often send roaring avalanches sweeping all before
them into the valley below and far up the opposite side.</p>
<p>At the head of the valley lies the Asulkan glacier. It is of
the <i>piedmont type</i>, created by three commensal streams of ice.
According to Dr. Sherzer, it is now in its second childhood.
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
The piedmont characteristics are disappearing and the glacier
resolving itself into the original glaciers of alpine type which gave
rise to it.</p>
<p>It is easy of access from Glacier House, and of great interest
to observers. It has its chief source in the Asulkan icefield,
which leads to a snow crest or col, known as the Asulkan pass.
On the opposite side of the pass a steep descent brings one to
the ice stream of the Geikie glacier, the southern overflow of
the Illecillewaet icefield. Beyond, lies the steep icefall of the
Dawson glacier and Mts. Dawson and Selwyn, over 11,000
feet above sea level.</p>
<p>In the case of the Asulkan glacier, also, observations and
measurements were carried on by Messrs. Vaux and Miss Vaux.</p>
<p>On August 12, 1899, a rock in line with the farthest advanced
ice of the forefoot was marked. On August 8, 1900, the ice
had receded 24 feet. On August 6, 1901, the ice had advanced
36 feet. On July 23, 1906, the ice was again in line with the
rock; that is in the same position as in 1899.</p>
<p>Subsequent observations by Miss Vaux show that between
August 20, 1909, and July 27, 1912, the ice had retreated 259
feet from the marked rock. During the interval the observations
on August 9, 1911, show that the ice had again advanced 51
feet. No measurements made since that date have come to
the knowledge of the writer.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
